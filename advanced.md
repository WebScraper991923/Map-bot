Note, that it's important to regularly interact with the Gitpod environment, such as clicking within it every 30 minutes, to keep the machine active and prevent automatic shutdown. 

If you don't want to click every 30 minutes, then we encourage you to install Python and Node.js on your PC and run it locally.
